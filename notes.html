      <div class="note">Hey bestie ❤️<br><br>
This Christmas, I just want you to know how special you are to me.
Your smile makes my bad days better, and your presence feels like home.
I’m really lucky to have you in my life ❄️✨<br><br>
Merry Christmas, beautiful 🎁</div>
      <div class="note">If Christmas gave wishes instead of gifts,
mine would be you staying by my side — always ❤️<br><br>
You’re not just my bestie,
you’re the person I trust the most,
the one who understands me without words ❄️<br><br>
Merry Christmas to the one who means more than she knows 🎄✨</div>
      <div class="note">Some people come into our lives quietly
and end up meaning everything ❤️<br><br>
You are that person for me.
Thank you for the laughs, the talks, and the comfort.
This Christmas feels warmer knowing you’re in my life 🎄✨<br><br>
Always your bestie 🤍</div>
      <div class="note">Merry Christmas to the girl
who makes my days brighter just by existing ❤️<br><br>
I hope this little surprise makes you smile,
because your smile is my favorite thing ❄️✨<br><br>
Stay the same, stay amazing 🎄</div>
